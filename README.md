**Welcome to Solidity Contracts Repository**

---

### What's Inside?

Hey there! This cool repository is packed with two awesome Solidity contracts:

1. **ERC20 Token**: A versatile contract that brings ERC20 token magic to your fingertips. With functionalities for transferring, approving spending, minting, and burning tokens, it's your go-to solution for token management.

2. **Vault**: Need a secure place to stash your tokens? Look no further! The Vault contract lets you deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens with ease. It handles all the nitty-gritty calculations, making your token management experience smooth as butter.

### How to Use?

Using these contracts is a piece of cake:

- **ERC20 Token**: Simply deploy the contract and start minting tokens. Users can transfer tokens, approve spending, and even let others transfer tokens on their behalf.

- **Vault**: Deploy the Vault contract and connect it to your ERC20 token. Users can deposit tokens, and the Vault automatically calculates the shares to mint. Withdrawing tokens? No problem! The Vault handles everything for you.

### Let's Get Started!

1. **Setup**: Make sure you've got a Solidity development environment ready to roll. Tools like Truffle or Remix will do the trick.

2. **Testing**: Don't forget to test your contracts thoroughly! Cover all functionalities with comprehensive unit tests to ensure everything runs smoothly.

3. **Security**: Keep things safe and sound. Review the contracts for any security vulnerabilities and implement proper access controls.
